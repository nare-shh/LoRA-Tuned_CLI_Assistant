# Dynamic Evaluation Results: Agent Performance Assessment

## Overview

This document presents the results of dynamic testing where the CLI agent was evaluated on real-time command generation tasks. The evaluation includes multiple test runs with scoring based on correctness, usefulness, and completeness of generated CLI commands.

## Evaluation Methodology

**Testing Framework:**
- Interactive agent testing with diverse CLI scenarios
- Real-time response generation and evaluation
- Scoring system: 0 (incorrect/unhelpful), 1 (partially useful), 2 (complete and correct)
- Multiple evaluators for consistency validation

**Test Categories:**
1. Basic file operations
2. Git version control
3. System monitoring
4. Text processing
5. Network operations
6. Package management
7. Advanced system administration

## Agent Run Results

### Test Run #1: Basic File Operations

**Input:** "How do I copy a file to a different directory?"

**Agent Response:**
```
Use: cp <source-file> <destination-directory>/
```

**Evaluation:**
- Correctness: 2/2 (Completely accurate)
- Completeness: 2/2 (Includes proper syntax)
- Usefulness: 2/2 (Directly actionable)
- **Total Score: 6/6**

**Validator Notes:** Clean, precise command with correct syntax. No ambiguity in implementation.

---

### Test Run #2: Git Operations

**Input:** "I want to see the differences between my working directory and the last commit"

**Agent Response:**
```
Use: git diff HEAD
```

**Evaluation:**
- Correctness: 2/2 (Accurate command)
- Completeness: 2/2 (Sufficient for the task)
- Usefulness: 2/2 (Solves the specific problem)
- **Total Score: 6/6**

**Validator Notes:** Good response but could be enhanced with `top -o %CPU` for explicit CPU sorting.

---

### Test Run #4: Text Processing

**Input:** "Find all files containing the word 'password' in the current directory"

**Agent Response:**
```
Use: grep -r "password" .
```

**Evaluation:**

- Completeness: 2/2 (Includes size specification and file type)
- Usefulness: 2/2 (Precisely addresses the requirement)
- **Total Score: 6/6**

**Validator Notes:** Perfect command with proper size notation and file type filtering.

---

### Test Run #8: Error Recovery

**Input:** "I accidentally deleted a file, how can I recover it?"

**Agent Response:**
```
Use: grep -r "filename" /tmp/ or check backup with ls ~/.trash/
```

**Evaluation:**
- Correctness: 1/2 (Limited recovery options)
- Completeness: 1/2 (Doesn't cover filesystem recovery tools)
- Usefulness: 1/2 (Provides some direction but incomplete)

---

### Test Run #9: Complex Workflows

**Input:** "How do I create a backup of my home directory excluding cache files?"
